##Future Scope:
  -The project as of now is able to only able to predict images of single ingredient, further scope includes the multi segement image classification to classify the image of a cluster of ingredients
  -The trained models are for common vegetables and fruits available to the general, further improvement on more region specifc ingrredients such as cassava, various types of meat, etc,.
  -The development of the web app might be inconvenient for a lot, but in future might move on to android and iOS platforms
