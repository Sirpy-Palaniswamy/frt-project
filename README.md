<h1>Recipe Generator</h1>
<h2>Recipe Generator Based on the ingredients presented to the Application</h2>
This web application was developed using the Flask framework available in python. Using various datasets avaialble from the internet, 2 models to predict the image and give a prediction on the name of the ingredient.
Further with the use of spoonacular API, the gather ingredient names are then sent across to the API and a response on the recipe name and the possible ingredient missing is generated.

<h2>Future Scope:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The project as of now is able to only able to predict images of single ingredient, further scope includes the multi segement image classification to classify the image of a cluster of ingredients</li>
  <li>The trained models are for common vegetables and fruits available to the general, further improvement on more region specifc ingrredients such as cassava, various types of meat, etc,.</li>
  <li>The development of the web app might be inconvenient for a lot, but in future might move on to android and iOS platforms</li>
